This program finds a window with "Zoom Meeting" in the title, then moves a fixed
number of pixels - this was determined by trying it on only my machine, your
mileage may vary - and clicks on where the Reactions button is, then on the
Thumbs Up emoji.

On Windows you can create a link to this program on your Desktop, then hit the
Properties of this link and give it a shortcut like Ctrl+Alt+U which you can
then easily press in a Zoom meeting. No mouse for me!
